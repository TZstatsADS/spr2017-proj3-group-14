### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals. 

Below is an example. If no contribution statement is provided, we will insert a default statement that goes "**All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement**. "

Project 3

Team members: 

Summary: + Model evaluation and comparison: First, the baseline model uses gradient boosting machine (gbm) on 5000 SIFT features. Second, we tried to choosing 5000 SIFT features using LASSO method. Then using several machine learning methods including random forest, knn, xgboost, logistic regression, svm to classify these images. However we didn't get a good result. At last, our advanced model uses CNN and deep learning method which enhance the accuracy rate by 7%.

[Contribution Statement] Yijia Pan, Mengcheng Li, Han designed the study.  developed baseline classification model for evaluation. EF and GH explored feature engineering for improving the baseline model. AB, EF and GH discussed and designed the model evaluation protocol. CD carried out the computation for model evaluation. All team members contributed to the GitHub repository and prepared the presentation. All team members approve our work presented in our GitHub repository including this contribution statement.
